# Ethanol-plastics-and-butadiene-from-forestry-biomass-via-optimum-production-system

Presently, the desire to reduce import and raise balance of trade, and the need to mitigate problems of petroleum consumption
like CO2 emission and global warming, is driving nations into seeking renewable and sustainable alternatives. In this
work, optimized production system from robust comparison is used to estimate the potential of forestry waste woody
biomass for bioproducts worldwide and in Europe. Bioproducts considered are bioethanol for fuel, plastics (polyethylene,
polypropylene, polyvinylchloride, polystyrene, polyethylene-terephthalate) for material, and butadiene for chemical.
Chemical synthesis, syngas fermentation, direct fermentation and carboxylate routes to products were investigated. Smart
utilization increased production over a number of conversion routes. Optimum utilization patterns compared to when whole
biomass is used directly through (i) thermochemical route gave 16.7% increase in production (ii) biochemical route
provides 33.3% increase in production which represent significant savings for the biorefinery. It was found that while
52.7% and 71.9% of feedstock is required to satisfy demand for plastics worldwide and Europe respectively and, 2.7% and
4.5% of biomass worldwide and in Europe respectively is the feedstock level required to replace petroleum based butadiene
production, meeting 40% and 48.4% of gasoline energy demand worldwide and in Europe respectively completely deplete
this biomass resource.
